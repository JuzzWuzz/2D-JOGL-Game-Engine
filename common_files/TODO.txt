get the instruction from ubuntu forums about setting the right compiler so eclipse's compiler doesn't take over (which can't seem to run JOGL) 
    NOTE: TSL already seems to have the right compiler and JOGL compiles, must still test if it runs

DONE Change around GameFrame so that students have ability to add widgets etc

DONE: have multiple renering windows available... hmm ...lots of work ... maybe not
    DONE... not really planned but it's done
        Runs two separate games tho, must either make the timer sync up or advise not to use multiple frames
            Will advise not to use 2 or more frames

DONE Take out GLrotation and replace with multi-textured rotations (one for every 5 degree's or whatever)
    DONE Taken out rotations
    DONE multiple textures added

DONE Package up game java files so they can see each other but not outside classes

DONE GameObject class need to be reworked
    Just adding on functions as needed

DONE enable double buffering

DONE make offset for drawing pane (for following around ship etc)

DONE do proper cleanup of textures in GameObject class

DONE fix centering of images for subImages

DONE Add asteroids

***************FOR DEMO*********************

DONE Split up AsteroidGame and GameObject classes into separate files

DONE Make asteroids move
DONE Make asteroids break up

DONE Make sure, you don't start on top of an asteroid
    Well... students can do this

DONE Plan lecture
    Things to mention:
        The game loop
            Have to run doTimestep for each unit in logicStep()
            Have to run draw for each unit in render step
        The Game class and GameCanvas. Adding widgets and not adding two GameCanvas's to the same window
        GameObject and it's subclasses
            Textures, subtextures and multi-textures
        isKeyDown() and the control interface
        
        The 4 parts of the prac
            A specification
            B Collision detection (show code)
            C Features and content (textures and add a quick fun feature)
                Mention that features include anything that makes the game playing experiance more rewarding/fun - i.e. menus, saving all help
            D AI - pathfinding - refresh grid every few seconds

DONE Clean up code

DONE Limit speed
	Added friction

DONE Draw [line pixel quad triangle] array? () functions

DONE do basic collision detection system
    DONE bounding box
    DONE bit test ?
        DONE Get access to image bufferw

***************FOR ALPHA*********************

DONE Abstract away game package so students only see .class files
	DONE or just jar them

COMMENTING! dear goodness I need to do commenting and documentation :(
	DONE How to
	DONE JavaDocs :(
	DONE Bug reporting
	Revision
	   DONE Update uncommented methods and classes
	   Mention that really large textures should be loaded up as multiple smaller ones

DONE Make GameDrawer class for renderStep (like TextureLoader for the inintStep)

DONE Fonts

***************FOR BETA*********************

DONE Colour tinting and fading out/transparency

DONE Abstract GL gl in renderStep away from student

DONE Abstract texture loading into some sort of TextureLoader class passed to intiStep()

Fix concurrentModification exception that crops up :(
	cant replicate this

DONE Make sure students can't hack their way into the Game package :)
    This is not doable really, will instruct students not to do this

DONE Make asteroids blow off in non-random directions using physics 'n stuff
    Maybe leave this? It's doable but would add a lot of extra code (don't want to scare of the students now...)

DONE Control Interface
    DONE Keyboard
    DONE Mouse, mousemotion
    DONE MouseWheel
    
DONE Do Eclipse version
	TEST Make compatible for command line users
	TEST Windows XP
	
DONE add debug tools
	DONE draw bounding box
	   well they can draw it themselves

DONE Add scaling to the fonts, add getStringwidth for determining stringwidth

**************FOR FINAL*******************

Fix funny little bar the shows up at bottom of AsteroidTexture

MAYBE DONE Textures
    BROKEN, must fix (just that one bug loading power of 2 square pictures)
        FIXED... maybe, depends on the mipmap problem :/

make fullscreenable (?)

fix mipmap blocky background problem
    Can't replicate problem ??
